# Why the book

Welcome to Building a PPX from the Ground Up. The goal of this book is to create a walkthrough for creating
a project from the environment up.

I'm writing this book because I found much of the documentation to be API focused and have very little in the
way the tooling works together. This was especially true for setting up the environment before even writing a
single line of code.

## Enform - the project

This project tracks my building of the Enform library. The library is a set PPX utilities to assist in
building forms for ReasonReact. As such, much of the focus will be on a holistic app touching both backend
and UI/UX.
