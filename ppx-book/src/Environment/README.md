# Setting up the environment

One of the hardest things I've found in my years as a developer is finding a tutorial on setting up a
development environment. It's usually a case of "How do X? Oh, that's easy using A, B, C, and D already setup
on your system".

This section is how I set up the global tools used in the environment. If I've done my job right, this should
be enough to understand how they relate and be able to use the individual documentation to tweak them as your
project needs.
