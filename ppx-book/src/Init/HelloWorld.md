# Hello World

"Begin with the end in mind" - Stephen Covey

Hello world here is our walking skeleton. We should be able to see our workflow and see how our project
cycles through it's entire process, from writing a line of code to the deployment.

For me, step 1 is starting with the the end - the example. If we don't know where we're going, it's impossible
to map how we get there.
