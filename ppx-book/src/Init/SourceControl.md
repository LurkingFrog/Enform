Create a repo on github.com
[instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

Git clone the new repo into a directory and then switch into it.

Update the .gitignore with:

```shell

# The directory where temporary and final files are placed
build

# per package build files
_esy


# Installed Javascript modules from npm
node_modules
```
