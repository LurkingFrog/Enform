# Install Esy

Esy is a simplified workflow engine for common development actions. [docs](https://esy.sh/docs/) We want to
install this as it allows combining both JavaScript (npm) and OCaml (opam) workflows and library integration
into a single command. This may not be necessary if what you are writing is a pure web project.

```npm install -g esy```
